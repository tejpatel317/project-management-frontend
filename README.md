# Project Management API

Welcome to a project management API which will allow you to keep track of your ongoing projects and manage employee assignments.

## Project-Management Backend

The backend for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/tejpatel317/project-management-backend).

## Description

Scope is a project management application which will allow project managers to keep track of their projects, and see which employees are assigned to each project. Scope will generate a project card for each project that is created by the project manager. Similarly, for each employee in the company, Scope will create employee avatars. On this web application, project managers will be able to search projects, search employees, delete projects, and assign employees to projects. Once an employee is assigned to a project, the project card and employee avatar modals will be updated to reflect the assignment. 

## Usage

This application has three main navigation panels which include the homepage, project form, and employee form. The homepage is where the bulk of the application's content lies as it is where the project cards and employee avatars are rendered. The project form will allow users to create new projects, while the employee form will allow users to create new employees. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
