# Project Management API

Welcome to a project management API which will allow you to keep track of your ongoing projects and manage employee assignments.

## Project-Management Backend

The backend for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/tejpatel317/project-management-backend).

## Description

Scope is a project management application which will allow project managers to keep track of their projects, and see which employees are assigned to each project. Scope will generate a project card for each project that is created by the project manager. Similarly, for each employee in the company, Scope will create employee avatars. On this web application, project managers will be able to search projects, search employees, delete projects, and assign employees to projects. Once an employee is assigned to a project, the project card and employee avatar modals will be updated to reflect the assignment. 

## Usage

This application has three main navigation panels which include the homepage, project form, and employee form. The homepage is where the bulk of the application's content lies as it is where the project cards and employee avatars are rendered. The project form will allow users to create new projects, while the employee form will allow users to create new employees. 

## How To Use

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install

# starts React application
npm start
```
